# Head-Pose-Estimation-

Head Pose Estimation Project 
trying with mediapipe and dlib
1- Create a head pose estimator that can tell where the head is facing in degrees using Python and OpenCV and MediaPipe Face Mesh which estimates 468 3D face landmarks.

2- trying to compute the head rotation based on these landmarks
